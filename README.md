# **WireBot~High-Voltage Electrical Wire Inspection Robot**

## **Overview**
An autonomous robot for inspecting high-voltage wires, capable of traversing junctions and obstacles. Equipped with sensors for real-time wire inspection, it reduces human effort and enhances safety.

## **Features**
- **Junction Traversing**: Synchronized arm movements for smooth navigation.  
- **Real-Time Inspection**: Cameras and sensors for wire condition monitoring.  
- **Multi-Axis Balancing**: X and Y-axis stabilization during traversal.  
- **Modular Design**: Adjustable for different wire configurations.  

## **Future Work**
- Automate and fine-tune traversal for smooth operation.  
- Dynamic Y-axis balancing during arm engagement.  
- Adjustable arm height for uneven wires.  
- File a patent for the complete system.  

## **Timeline**
1. **Month 1**: Mechanical design and basic movement control.  
2. **Month 2**: Obstacle detection and PID-based control.  
3. **Month 3**: Junction-crossing mechanism and wire inspection.  
4. **Month 4**: System optimization and documentation.
