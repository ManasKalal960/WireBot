# **High-Voltage Electrical Wire Inspection Robot**

## **Project Overview**
This project aims to design and build a robot that autonomously inspects high-voltage electrical transmission wires, reducing the need for human intervention and increasing safety. The robot will move along the wire using three arms, each equipped with motor-driven wheels, and will navigate obstacles such as insulators and junctions using a precise control system. Various sensors, including cameras, will perform real-time inspection of the wire, gathering data on its condition.

This repository will serve as the main hub for tracking the progress of the project, including mechanical design, control system development, and sensor integration. The project is expected to be completed over 4 months, with continuous updates as the development progresses.

## **Project Goals**
1. **Design a Robot**: Build a robust, autonomous robot capable of moving along high-voltage wires, navigating obstacles, and inspecting the wires in real-time.
2. **Control System Development**: Implement a control system to manage the robotâ€™s movement, balance, and sensor-based obstacle detection, using a combination of PID controllers and state machines.
3. **Wire Inspection**: Integrate sensors such as cameras and thermal sensors for wire condition monitoring.
4. **Robust Mechanics**: Design a system for smooth wheel engagement and disengagement, ensuring minimal vibration on the wire.
5. **Documentation**: Over the 4-month development period, document all phases of the project, which will culminate in a comprehensive final report and documentary.
